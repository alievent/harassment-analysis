0012	this report will allow you to understand why girls are forced to commit suicide . you might be seeing on tv and news these days , how girls commit suicide because of blackmailing and sexual harassment . this is my story . i am 15 . i had gone to visit my friend and on her street i noticed a guy staring at me . he was 18 or 19 . he even winked at me , whistled , commented and what not . i ignored him and paced to my friend s place . i told her about this incident and she was mad at me , she wanted to go and confront that guy . we forgot about him and talked about ourselves for the rest of the afternoon . in the evening , i was totally shocked when i saw the same guy enter my friend s house . she introduced him as her brother and that s when i was speechless . the guy grinned at me dirtily and went to his room . my friend that day had got me a dress and she wanted me to try it on and show it to her . i was in no mood , i was disgusted , i wanted to shout at her brother , tell my friend all about him , but i kept quiet . i succumbed to her pressure and went and changed my dress . after showing her the dress , when i was going back to change into my original one , i noticed him standing near the staircase smiling in an evil way . he blocked my way , held my hand and forced me to see a video on his one . i was horrified when i saw its my video while i was changing my clothes in the toilet . i started crying and begged him to delete it . he said he will only if i have sex with him . at that moment as i was pleading and begging , i don t know how i got the strength to slap him . my friend heard the noise and came out where we were , i told her everything , she was speechless and did not know how to react . she cried and said many things to her brother . things were never the same after that , neither was i .

0006	i think there is no woman who has not gone through some form of sexual harassment in this country . it is sad that i cant step outside my home without a hint of fear in my mind . i have had experiences standing at my bus stop as a child , with a friend of mine waiting for my school bus to come , when a man in a big car took rounds throwing pieces of paper with his number written on it . then there was another time when i was standing outside my house waiting for a friend to come pick me up when a car stopped and refused to leave until he saw my friend come . for god s sake right outside my house ? ! ? i would like to state another example when me and my friend were returning from the market in a rickshaw and we were followed by a car full of men passing lewd comments and the rickshaw guy had the sense of taking a different route . when he dropped us home he asked us didi kya aap un logo ko jaanti thi ? and i replied saying no , and his answer was isliye maine doosra raasta le liya . what i m trying to say here is that it is not just the poor and uneducated people to blame every single time , there are educated men from well to do families in big cars doing this ! ! ! another time i was stopped by a well spoken man on the defence colony kotla road again in a big car asking if i want to be friends and whether he can drop me home , when i said no he kept following me , i had to go to a crowded place in my market in the colony to get away from him . another thing i would like to say is that the i am a resident of defence colony which is supposedly a colony for the defence people , should be safe but sadly it isn t . nearly every evening i notice prostitutes standing in nooks and corners amp cars stopping and picking them up inside the colony itself . there are a number of lady boys who stand right at road that turns into defence colony opposite the lajpat nagar metro station . at the turn there is a police check post at night for so called security reasons and they stop cars as and when they want (only when they re bored or want to make some money) . do they not know that these lady boys prostitutes stand there and get picked up every night ? ? ? what is the police doing ? ? ? it happens right under their noses and they re oblivious to it ! ! ! this is a great initiative but i hope it continues and is not short lived . we really need to do something to bring about a change in the mindset of people in this country which ironically worships goddesses ! !

0004	it was my first day in bangalore(after spending 4 years in delhi) . my kitchen was not yet set up hence we(me and my male friend) went out for dinner to a restaurant which was located at a very central area . at about 1030pm , we were done with our dinner and while heading towards my car which was parked about 500 meters from the restaurant , four men(looked like in their forties) started calling me out , saying excuse me , on turning towards them , they started teasing me , passing comments like miss you , hello and all . my friend got furious with them but i somehow managed to convince him to get into the car and we chose not to react . however , my friend asked me to stay inside the car and went out to note down their car number . these men seemed to notice him note down their car number , and after a while , they started man handling him . fortunately i had a naga chilly spray with me . i took that out , ran towards them and managed to knock out three of them with the same . the fourth man got hold of my hand and pushed me down the road , and i hit my head . the saddest part was that people around were watching as if there is a drama being played on the road . nobody came for help . while my friend was busy at the other end trying to fight with the rest of them , i saw one of the men take out iron rods from their car dickey . i pulled my friend telling him no one is gonna come for help and we will not be able to help ourselves either . we ran towards the car and immediately went inside . on turning the car to take a uturn , two or three of them came running towards us with the intention to hit us , but since we were already inside , they smashed all sides of my car glasses . we rushed to the nearest police station asking for help . on showing them their car number(which my friend luckily noted down) , the police personnel hesitated to file an fir(as per our understanding , they seemed to be local political goons residing in the same area . we left my car at the police station for the night , returned home at about 3am in the morning and again went back to the police station for filing the fir . after repeated failed request , we had to use my friend s position(he is in the army) , we spoke to the head of that police station and filed the fir . i was totally devastated from inside and wanted to leave bangalore the very day . i cried the whole night and asked my friend to drop me home , maybe for a month , or two , or maybe forever , but i woke up the next day , and decided to fight this out . being a woman living alone in the city , with different looks and a car that these people can easily identify , i didn t want to get into the mess of making rounds at the police station , and court case(my friend also had to leave for work in few days) , i decided to take back the fir but also stay back in bangalore and move on . we looked for a new house the very same day and i moved to a farther and safer house . it may be a question on someone s head as to why i withdrew the fir and didn t try to punish those culprits . but we all know that the country that we live in . even murderers are set free from punishment , leave aside eve teasers and people who made injury to us physically and damaged our property . this is a story , not only because i want to share one , but it shows how our own country has failed to protect its own citizens , a story of the faith that a woman doesn t have in her country s governing authority , a story that shows how we humans lag in being a helping hand when others are in need(yes , there were families watching the incident) , a story to tell , that no matter how much hatred the world puts into you , you still need to have a love for humanity , a story , hoping that we(women) shall overcome from all these pain one day . . . . .

0000	n the eyes of many , the offices of pakistan are filled with lecherous bosses . all too often , working women have tales of their perversions the lesser ones include gaze and glance , the occasional grope , the unwanted text message , the innuendo the bigger ones include invitations to meet outside the office , over lunch or dinner with plum assignments , promotions , job security and professional reputations hanging in the balance . resignation is no guarantee of reprieve there are reference letters to be obtained , future employment to be worried about . in an expensive , inflationwracked and increasingly competitive pakistani workplace , there are many women who continue to be targets for men with power . the arithmetic of want and need is in display divorced women , single mothers , the older and the unmarried are particularly vulnerable to harassment . in the words of one single mother who endured 10 years of harassment , the pursuit is constant , and any attempt to escape is punished further with denials of promotions and humiliation before colleagues . coworkers , often witnesses , say nothing , eager to avoid a situation that could result in retaliation , a loss of their own positions . sexual harassment from superiors is hence often coupled with isolation by colleagues who watch , witness and withdraw . the harassed are not only the persecuted but also the pariah . there is a law against all this in pakistan . the protection against harassment of women at the workplace act 2010 , which will be six years old , is a thorough document . the code of conduct included in it defines harassment as any unwelcome sexual advance , request for sexual favours or other verbal or written communication or physical conduct of a sexual nature , or sexually demeaning attitudes , causing interference with work performance or creating an intimidating , hostile or offensive work environment , or the attempt to punish the complainant for refusal to comply with such a request or is made a condition for employment . it goes on to add that the above is unacceptable behaviour in the organisation and at the workplace , including in any interaction or situation that is linked to official work or official activity outside the office . the abuse of authority , creating a hostile work environment , and retaliation are the three categories that mandate action against a harasser . detailed stipulations are set out for the establishment of investigative committees , ombudspersons , etc , who are charged with resolving the issues raised . a range of penalties from censure to outright dismissal are postulated . all employers are required to display the code of conduct prominently on their premises . when the law was passed in 2010 , it was feted as a success . it would take time for its provisions to change the culture of the workplace , the more circumspect said . change comes slowly but a law is a first step a legislative commitment supported by elected representatives signals that the path ahead will be a different one , in this case one where the harassment of women in the workplace would not be permitted . not much has happened since then . harassment is still rampant in the workplace (the majority of workplaces have little idea as to what the code of conduct is , let alone of the requirement to display it visibly in employee areas) . women still regularly report being verbally harassed and even physically assaulted by their superiors who , making calculations regarding their need for a job , their desire to get ahead , their inability to refuse , unabashedly continue with such acts . in the face of unwanted advances , pakistans women continue to find themselves alone , unsure of where to take their complaints and how to protect themselves . even in the development sector , where the very agenda of many organisations is to empower women , similar problems persist . in one , a cofounder of an organisation faced so much harassment by a male colleague that she was ultimately forced out . new , more pliant women hired to take her position have since complained of similar problems . the man in question , however , remains untouched , undoubtedly displaying similarly harassing behaviour to new prey . other men have come to his defence perhaps recognising their own behaviour in those of others and eager to ensure that no one gets punished . misogyny is manufactured in two major flavours in pakistan . the first is on the premises of religious obscurantists whose hankering for the reinstatement of a strictly segregated society sees the harassmentfilled workplace as a grim substantiation of their warnings . women should not be in the workplace at all , the male conscience is unable to police itself . the second , one that wrongly labels itself as liberal and progressive , imagines it to mean a licence to harass and harangue . a womans willingness to put up and shut up is , in its mind , the product of this progressivism , its illogical mindset equating women in the public sphere with women sexually available to all men who may want them . the two flavours compete , their poisons infecting the working lives of women doctors , lawyers , shopkeepers , bankers , teachers , professors and countless others who are daily forcefed these bitter morsels of misogyny . laws alone cannot change society the sexual harassment of women (and nearly everyone who reads this article either knows someone or is someone who has faced harassment) continues because it is considered permissible , something women ask for when they leave their homes . this belief is reflected all the time and everywhere in pakistan , in soap operas that vilify working women as predators out to seduce innocent men , to workplace conversations in which men dissect the desirability of their female colleagues , their participation often a measure of a masculinity that fears competition from women . in the matter of sexual harassment in pakistans workplaces , there are the guilty and the very guilty , they are far too many men complicit , quiet , eager to embrace or enforce their right to harass .

0002	this article was written last year when this situation took place . i was barely entering 11th grade . now , as i leave high school with flashbacks of this day and all the times my body has been the empty canvas for boys to splatter paint on , i will tell you the story of a 10th grader in gurgaon . the strangers lips grazed upon the ends of my cheek . my bruised arm was pinned down on the dusty grey ground of the room while i kept my alert eyes outside on the faces of unknown men in uniform . they smirked as the stranger slid his snakelike fingers down my body . he struggled to undo the button . i could feel my eyes turn red when i bit him hard into his shoulder and in a small voice said , no , i have to leave . i dont like this . i felt the empty liquor bottle against my legs and his hands against my flesh . i jerked up and pushed him aside . my head buzzed of alcohol and panic as i managed to stand up and look around . did i really want this ? he straightened up and pressed my frail body upon the naked wall . no , i did not . i pushed him aside and ran towards the open hall . men of all ages stood on the railings , oblivious of the act . my cheeks burned of forced kisses and shame . holding my shoes in my hands , i scurried through the staircase in the search of a known face . who was i looking for ? who was i running from ? i reached the cold lobby of an office . i stared at the entrance , and there he was my strange glaring at my anxious face . he shoved my stiff self on the closed elevator , seeking to unfasten my pair of shorts . he settled for forcing his slithering fingers down my waist . he whispered , i am going to finger you like an asshole , as i whimpered and hopped away from him . i felt the back of my clothes , seeking for a phone . it wasnt there . a rush of panic and exhaustion , and i fled out of the office to the hallway . i rummaged around the building , exploring every step i took earlier , to search for a prized possession . it was not there . my eyes burned even more now . tears blinded my vision and settled on my raw cheeks . he was behind me . i rushed downstairs and headed for the busy road . it was broad daylight , as i scuttled barefoot in the search of my friend . it was too late . she was gone , and my stranger was behind me , grabbing my shirt . his strong hands ripped the cloth . my bare back became exposed to the blinking lights and stare of million nameless men . i cried for help but nobody cared enough to hear . i ran faster , without the possession of a phone , money or my bag . why was i here ? i gazed at the crowd nearby . i came to rest on a staircase . tears ran down my face , unknown figures settled around me but in my head , i knew what to do . him , i whispered as i strived to punch the familiar number down on a phone . do you remember the moment when you were child and you had gone astray from your parents in a crammed up market place ? how at that moment , you were devoid of any thoughts and the only thought of worth was how to get back to your safe haven ? do you remember the worry on their faces ? that moment was of such magnitude . i shook back and forth , glancing through abundant faces , unable to see his delicate features muddled up with concern . men and women walked past me , putting forward a helping hand but i did not trust them . it was a matter of minutes , when his agonized face rushed past me . i stood up and ran towards his open arms . the world stood still as he held me . i took in the accustomed smell of his cologne and felt a homesick wave crash on the walls of my head . im scared , hes going to find me . i said , and that was enough for him to know . he took out a grey shirt from his bag and walked me out of the eyesight of alien people . wear it , he murmured and propped his hand on my shoulders to pull me close . he rescued my other friend from the clutches of my stranger and his friends and departed from the cursed location . the ride ended at my house . he held my face and in a low voice , inaudible to my friend in the next room , asked me for a favour . dont do anything stupid , he said anxiously , as if reading my mind . the state of my friend was beyond the category of wasted , and following his given duty , he picked her up from the marble floor and led her towards the societys gates . he waved a brief goodbye and timidly walked away from me . sometimes , you dont need words to explain how you feel . sometimes , you just know . like that , i just knew . there , enfolded in his scent from his shirt , i felt possible . i was petrified from the episode , but his face made it easier to breathe in . sometimes , you dont need to be dating or loving somebody for months to feel comfortable with . you dont need to kiss him , or even have him around you all the time . just his nervous presence lingering around you in that moment is enough to demonstrate and establish a brief connection . he was my safe haven , even if for those few minutes . i was sorry that it was over but all the more glad , he was there for me . when he said those words on the phone , they were a formality . but standing there in the park , watching him walk towards the gates , i could feel it happening . it may not have been an episode of such importance for him , but for me , it changed everything . im sorry that the dance ended , but there , in your arms , i swear the world stood impossibly still . i attempted suicide a few hours later , but i was saved . and i live to be strong , and tell you this story .

0003	harassment is a blow any girl can suffer anywhere . harassment is not necessarily an attack by just strangers , it can be an intense assault within the confinements of your house you considered your home . here i am typing my own story of an account which shook my life and left it scarred in a way that i attest as irreversible . on an eventful sunday , i returned home to an eerie silence . the tension in the air was palpable and the looks in the eyes of my dad were unmistakably of anger . i kept quiet and walked to my room , hoping that i was just worrying for no reason . i slouched on my bed with a slice of chocolate cake and tuned into my favorite channel on tv . two hours later i was summoned by my dad for a discussion and i knew at that very moment that all my fears will materialize in a span of few seconds . i come from a conservative family , where i am the only girl who is working in a corporate , who is career oriented , and independent in her thoughts and actions . truly liberal and yet righteous in my thoughts , i have never questioned my approach towards life . i have been constantly put down by my family , i have incessantly been compared to my elder brother , my thoughts have been suppressed , and my ideals have been questioned . that night , my dad was furious for i was out on a sunday with my friends for a social cause , in a mixed group of girls and guys , which was unacceptable to him though god knows why he coeducated me though god knows why despite being an educated man , his thoughts were shallow and hurtful as they demeaned women . he was in a rage that i was too independent for his governance and societal norms . he considered my independence and will to make a mark as insolence and immoral . he wanted me to be confined to the four walls of my house , preparing myself to get married without even realizing my dreams . as i sat there objecting , he asked for my phone and decided to cut me off from my social circle . he crushed my brand new phone to pieces and threw the broken pieces right at my face , the shattered screen leaving scratches wherever the tiny broken glasses pricked me . as i further relented , he hurled abuses and called me names a father can never associate with his own daughter . my tears had dried listening to it all , i was feeling stronger and motivated to not succumb to this harassment this was the worst i had seen and somewhere it brought me to peace that i had already faced the worst . i constantly defended my education , my career , and my strong ideals against his baseless , autocratic , and barbaric thoughts . i would call it barbaric as i could have never imagined that my own father would move agitatedly around looking for a knife in the kitchen to further harm me . that just killed every emotion i could associate with a fatherdaughter relationship . i stood upto him and looked him in the eye and told him that this was the worst thing he could ever do and he shall never be forgiven . our relationship ended that night and i havent spoken to him eversince . as i walked out of that room , and not that house , just for the sake of my mother , i wept endlessly in my room , not able to fathom what just happened to me and why . my dads extreme behavior , the silence of my mother , and the fear in my brothers eyes made me realize how shallow our society is how can we even call it a society where ones life means nothing just because she is a girl . who allows them to believe that women are weak or inferior ? there is absolutely no logic , no rationale , and absolutely no forgiveness for anyone who cannot respect a woman , be it our own parents . i know of so many girls who are living a far more dreadful existence and i have penned my story not for sympathy , not for appreciation for standing up for myself , but simply to encourage all the women and men reading this to propagate an understanding of how beautiful , divine , and amazing women are as gods creation . i want us all to make a society where every woman is safe , happy , and successful where every woman is an equal to every man . do not cry , do not lose hopes , and do not deprive yourself of education as that is your true independence and absolute achievement . as we pin the creeps across the cities , and enlist all the crime spots around us , we need to realize that women are suffering at the hands of their own families . a true movement of women safety will begin when all the women stand up for themselves . only when you respect yourself will the world respect you . stay strong , stay safe !
